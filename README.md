# Adverse Media

Adverse Media screening is a required step in the know your customer (KYC) process. We screen for information about the individual that would point to crimes or reputational risks.

Keyword searches have traditionally been the method relied on for screening news but this process is largely automated by large language models capable of reading and identifying risks in any number of articles. 

The result is a race to the bottom as providers of adverse media solutions compete in scraping the most websites leading to noise.

Adverse Media suffers from noise because clients and providers fundamentally do not fully understand what "good coverage" looks like. One reason is that there is no directory of all the world's newspapers let alone a common framework for labelling and discussing sources. 

Our research seeks to answer what "good coverage" looks like in Adverse Media and, in the process, develop tools and datasets that help fill the gap in research and cut through the noise.
